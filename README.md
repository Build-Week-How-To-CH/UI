To read the html in this document reference the class names as they will help when reading the style sheet as they are named to be naturally easy.

The "Con" tag is shown through out the style sheet and is just used to show that element is on the about.html page to keep certain usability differing from the classes on the index.html page.

The chat bubble are always accompanied by the :after elements so keep an eye on those as well when resizing the site after edits.
